Welcome to my Python Crash Course repo. This is where I am storing the files that I create by following the book
_Python Crash Course_ by Eric Matthes. In case it is not obvious, I am _not_ a software developer by any means. 
That doesn't mean I'm not trying! This is a way to challenge myself.

Am I good? Not by any means. I ask that you try not to be mean about anything that I commit. There is a huge difference
between _constructive criticism_ and being an asshole. 

I dual sync this repo with my on-prem private git server.
